A more detailed Build Process

### Sprint 0: Getting raspberry pi to work

Initially I was hardcoding my e-ink code using nano in the raspberry pi command line. This was, as expected, not ideal. 

To alleviate this, I linked the directory I am working within to github and started edditing code on my mac. 

Things I learned:
- use access token instead of password

### Sprint 1: Writing test code

Now I want to flesh out some custom code, here's what I did:

- Copy the libraries needed from the waveshare wiki
- See thier test code on how the libraries work
- write the test code
